Below is a detailed set of instructions that you (or any developer joining the project) can follow to understand the project structure and build the site using Vite.

## 1. Project Structure

The **Aztek-Site** repository is organized to provide a clear separation between source code, assets, and build configuration. Here’s a typical breakdown of the folders and files you’ll encounter:

- **`/public`**  
  This directory holds static assets that are served directly. For example, the main HTML file (often `index.html`) and any images, fonts, or other assets that do not require processing are placed here.

- **`/src`**  
  This is where the majority of your application code resides:
  - **`main.js`
    The entry point for your application. This is where your application is bootstrapped, and where Vite starts processing your module graph.
  - **`/assets`**  
    Contains images, icons, or other media files used by your project. These are processed by Vite’s asset handling features.
  - **`/components`** (if applicable)  
    A common folder for storing reusable UI components. This can include everything from simple buttons to more complex layout components.
  - **Other folders/files**  
    Depending on the complexity of your project, you might have additional directories such as `/styles` for CSS/SCSS files or `/utils` for helper functions.

- **`package.json`**  
  This file handles project metadata, scripts, and dependencies. You’ll find the build and development commands defined here (like `"dev"`, `"build"`, and `"preview"`).

- **`vite.config.js`**  
  The configuration file for Vite. This file allows you to customize Vite’s behavior, plugins, and server settings.

- **`node_modules`**  
  The directory where all project dependencies are installed (generated by running the package manager command).

This structure is designed to ensure a smooth development experience and to separate concerns between static content, source code, and tooling configurations.

## 2. How to Build (Using Vite)

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine as well as building it for production:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed (LTS version is recommended).  
- A package manager like **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn/pnpm** if you prefer.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeoNae27/aztek-site.git
   ```
   Then change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd aztek-site
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all required dependencies using npm (or your preferred package manager):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will read the `package.json` file and install everything into the `node_modules` folder.

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server with Vite to see your changes live:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Upon running this, Vite will launch a local server (often on `http://localhost:3000` by default) and enable hot module replacement for a quick development iteration.

4. **Build for Production**

   To create a production-ready bundle, build the project using the Vite build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Vite will process your application, compile assets, and place the output in a `dist` folder (or another folder as specified in your `vite.config.js`).

5. **Preview the Production Build**

   To locally preview the production build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This command starts a local server that serves the contents of the production build, allowing you to test the site in a production-like environment.

## Additional Considerations

- **Customizing Vite Configuration:**  
  If you need to adjust Vite’s behavior (such as changing the port, adding plugins, or modifying build options), edit the `vite.config.js` file. The Vite documentation provides in-depth details on how to leverage these configurations for your needs.

- **Asset Handling:**  
  Vite processes static assets referenced in your code (like images and styles) for efficient bundling. Placing assets in the `public` folder will bypass any additional build processing, which is handy for files that don’t need transformation.

- **Extending the Project:**  
  As your project grows, consider creating additional directories under `/src` for various concerns (like routing, state management, or API calls). A well-organized structure will greatly aid in scalability and maintenance.

These instructions should help you and any collaborators get acquainted with the project structure and the build process using Vite. If you have any questions about further customizing or extending the project, the Vite documentation is a fantastic resource for advanced configurations. Enjoy coding your site!
